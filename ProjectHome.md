The SteamProfile repository has been moved to Github! New versions are now released on https://github.com/ata4/steamprofile.

## About SteamProfile ##

SteamProfile is an Ajax-based Java-Script widget to embed the profile status of a Steam Community member into a HTML webpage.

It uses the [Steam Community XML API](https://partner.steamgames.com/documentation/community_data) to read the raw data and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) for the transformation into HTML elements.

PHP is used as well for a server-side XML proxy to ensure fast and stable XML delivery.

## History ##

I'm currently working on version 2.0, which is the successor of the old SteamProfile that was distributed in [this thread](http://forum.mods.de/bb/thread.php?TID=184874&PID=1240721525) on [forum.mods.de](http://forum.mods.de/bb/). The old version uses IFrames for HTML and is completely server-sided. However, I plan to remake the image generator of the previous version as well.
